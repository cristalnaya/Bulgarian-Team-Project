            studies. I am now working anymore, but I have my own horse-Mel Mirilla. I trained her and from last year we
            started to
            compete in showjumping. Otherwise I like cycling (any so many other sports)-I have completed the competition

        <h3>How you came here ?</h3>
        <p>A while ago, in the begining of this year I got my first Udacity scholarship, which was for Android
            development. I found out about it by
            accident, while browsing for some coding lessons, since I was a total begginer back than and didn't really
            know what I want to do and where I kan find good learning resources. The project I made
            from my first scholarship was one of the reasons I got my job, so I kept following and when I saw this
            scholarship I applied without giving it a second thought. </p>

        <h3>What did you learn from this course?</h3>
        <p>Since I am working as a Front-end I already knew lots of things. Yet I am mostly self-though and I have never
            had things explained to me the way I get the explanations in Udacity. This way I got to realise why many
            things are done the way they are done and helped my structure my knowledge better helping me improve the
            code that I write. Furthermore my JavaScript is still not the best, so all of those exercises were very
            useful. </p>

            <p>There is no particular person. I get inpired by the whole community, because I can find every answer
                there. What I really liked was how easy and simple are the explanations of the Forum Mentors. Sometimes
                I understand a problem I've been reading about for lots of time just from 5 lines of explanation. I do
                enjoy this community forum and recently I understood what a powerful learning tool it is.</p>
